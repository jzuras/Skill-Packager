# Skill Packager

Package Claude Code CLI skills for use in Claude.ai web version.

## Overview

**skill-packager** is a Claude Code skill that enables you to create skills in the CLI and then package them as `.skill` files for upload to Claude.ai web version via Settings â†’ Capabilities.

This bridges the gap between the two environments, allowing you to:
- Develop skills with CLI's superior file operations and testing capabilities
- Share skills with web-only users
- Maintain a single skill codebase that works in both environments

## Features

- âœ… **Validates skill structure** - Checks YAML frontmatter and directory structure
- âœ… **Cross-platform support** - PowerShell script for Windows, Python script for Linux/macOS/WSL
- âœ… **Proper ZIP packaging** - Creates correctly structured `.skill` files
- âœ… **File overwrite protection** - Prompts before overwriting existing packages
- âœ… **Detailed error messages** - Clear feedback when validation fails
- âœ… **Compatible with both old and modern PowerShell** - Works with `powershell.exe` and `pwsh`

## Installation

### For Claude Code CLI Users

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your Claude skills directory:

```bash
# Personal skills (available in all projects)
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/jzuras/skill-packager.git

# OR for project-specific installation
cd your-project/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/jzuras/skill-packager.git
```

2. **Verify installation**:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/skill-packager/
# Should show: SKILL.md, scripts/, README.md
```

3. **That's it!** Claude Code will automatically recognize the skill.

### Requirements

**Windows:**
- PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7+
- No additional dependencies

**Linux/macOS/WSL:**
- Python 3.6+
- No additional packages required (uses standard library only)

## Usage

### In Claude Code CLI

Simply ask Claude to package a skill:

```
"Package my glyph-list skill for web use"
```

Claude will:
1. Validate the skill structure
2. Check if the output file already exists (and prompt if it does)
3. Run the appropriate packaging script for your platform
4. Create a `.skill` file ready for upload

**Default Output Location:** The `.skill` file is created in the directory where the command runs. When Claude packages skills, it typically runs from `~/.claude/skills/` (or `.claude/skills/` for project skills), placing the output file alongside your skill directories.

### Manual Usage (Advanced)

You can also run the packaging scripts directly:

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd ~/.claude/skills
pwsh ./skill-packager/scripts/package_skill.ps1 skill-name

# With custom paths
pwsh ./skill-packager/scripts/package_skill.ps1 my-skill -SourcePath ~/.claude/skills -OutputPath ./output
```

#### Linux/macOS/WSL (Python)

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills
python3 skill-packager/scripts/package_skill.py skill-name

# With custom paths
python3 skill-packager/scripts/package_skill.py my-skill ~/.claude/skills ./output
```

### Upload to Claude.ai Web

After packaging:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Capabilities** in Claude.ai
2. Click **"Upload Custom Skill"**
3. Select your `.skill` file
4. The skill will be available in future web chats

## Skill Structure Requirements

Skills must follow this structure to be packaged:

```
skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md              (required: YAML frontmatter + instructions)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              (optional: executable code)
â”œâ”€â”€ references/           (optional: additional documentation)
â””â”€â”€ assets/               (optional: templates, images, etc.)
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it"
---
```

**Requirements:**
- `name`: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars)
- `description`: clear explanation (max 1024 chars)

Optional fields:
- `license`: License information
- `allowed-tools`: Array of tool names the skill can use

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Packaging

```
User: "Package the glyph-list skill"

Claude:
[+] Packaging skill: glyph-list
[v] Skill structure validated: glyph-list
[+] Creating package: ~/.claude/skills/glyph-list.skill
  + glyph-list/SKILL.md
[v] Skill packaged successfully!
  File: ~/.claude/skills/glyph-list.skill
  Size: 0.6 KB
```

### Example 2: Handling Existing File

```
User: "Package glyph-list for web"

Claude: "I found that ~/.claude/skills/glyph-list.skill already exists.
What would you like to do?"

Options:
- Overwrite existing file
- Use different output directory

[User selects option, then Claude proceeds with packaging]
```

### Example 3: Creating and Packaging

```
User: "Create a skill that greets users, then package it for web"

Claude:
1. Creates the skill in ~/.claude/skills/my-greeter/
2. Writes SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
3. Tests it locally
4. Packages it to my-greeter.skill
5. Provides upload instructions
```

## Platform Compatibility

### Tool Availability

Both CLI and web versions have similar tool access:
- âœ… Bash commands
- âœ… File operations
- âœ… Python/script execution

Document any environment-specific considerations in your skill's SKILL.md.

### PowerShell Compatibility

The PowerShell script uses ASCII bracket notation (`[+]`, `[x]`, `[v]`) instead of emojis to ensure compatibility with:
- Modern PowerShell Core (`pwsh`)
- Legacy Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`)

## Troubleshooting

### "Skill directory not found"

**Problem:** Script can't locate the skill folder.

**Solution:**
- Verify the skill name matches the directory name exactly
- Check you're running from the correct parent directory
- Use absolute paths with `-SourcePath` parameter

### "SKILL.md must start with YAML frontmatter"

**Problem:** SKILL.md doesn't have proper frontmatter delimiters.

**Solution:** Ensure SKILL.md starts with:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "Description here"
---
```

### "ZIP doesn't contain skill folder at root"

**Problem:** The packaged file has the wrong structure.

**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with the provided scripts. If it does, please file an issue with:
- Your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- The command you ran
- The actual ZIP structure (`unzip -l skill-name.skill`)

### "Web version can't find SKILL.md"

**Problem:** After upload, Claude.ai doesn't recognize the skill.

**Solution:**
- Verify the skill name in frontmatter matches the folder name
- Check the ZIP structure contains `skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Re-package using the provided scripts

## Development Workflow

**Recommended workflow for skill development:**

1. **Create in CLI** - Use Claude Code's superior tooling
2. **Test in CLI** - Validate behavior with actual file operations
3. **Package** - Use this skill to create `.skill` file
4. **Upload to web** - Share via Settings â†’ Capabilities
5. **Test in web** - Verify it works in web environment
6. **Iterate** - Make changes in CLI, re-package, re-upload
